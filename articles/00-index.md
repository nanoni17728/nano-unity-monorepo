# Some adventure in Unity, Arcadia and Clojure

## 2021-09-10
Hi! If you’re reading this, chances are you found the repository and
you know a bit about one of the three technologies listed in this title.

Just in case though I would like to make a quick introduction as I aim
to publish all of this on my future website anyway.

When it comes to programming, functional languages and idioms are not in
the mainstream, bar a few things here and there. Immutability is still
something that people discover and try to wrap their head around, and
in certain cases it’s hard to build abstractions and architecture that
allows for this.

Such case is videogames programming. Making video games is a big case
of volatile mutable entities, a domain which oozes with states and
side effects. There is nearly nothing on making game the functional way.

And when I say nearly nothing, that means there are a couple of people
who are trying really hard to make it happen. I’m one of them, and I
believe that with the right approach, we can use functional programming
patterns to make gamedev enjoyable and less stressful.

Next time, I’ll go over Clojure, Arcadia and Unity one by one.
